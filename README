Dependencies
============

ocaml, with ocamllex and ocamlyacc


Compiling the program
=====================

  $ touch .depend
  $ make depend
  $ make all
or
  $ make opt


Running the program
===================

The program reads recursive definitions from standard input and checks if they
pass the size-change termination criterion.

To end the input, press Control-d.

To read definitions from a file, use
  $ ./sct < file

It is possible to change the value of bound B with
  $ ./sct -B 3
and to change the value of bound D with
  $ ./sct -D 4

For example, we get the original SCT with depth of values with
  $ ./sct -B 1 -D 0

It is possible to ask the program to print various information. Use
  $ ./sct -help
to get the list.


Syntax of recursive definitions
===============================

Recursive definitions are written with a very simple syntax similar to Haskell
definitions.
The aim was to make parsing and static analysis as simple as possible.

Each line (clause) of a recursive definition is of the form

  function_name  pattern*  =  body

where a "pattern" is a Caml (deep) pattern matching and "body" uses only
applications, constructors, tuples, variables from the patterns and other
function names.


Here is, for example, the Ackermann function:

ackermann Z[] Z[] = S[Z[]]
ackermann Z[] S[n] = S[S[n]]
ackermann S[m] Z[] = ackermann m S[Z[]]
ackermann S[m] S[n] = ackermann m (ackermann S[m] n)

The points to note are
  - each line corresponds a clause of the definition
  - constructors always have square brackets
  - the global environment of the definitions is empty
  - no type checking is done, only termination checking

Several examples are given in the "examples" directory.
